# Factorial
This repository contains the analysis and design of factorial problem with recursive soluction.

Factorial of a number can easily be computed with the help of recursive or non-recursive methods. Even though it is one of the easiest recursive problems exist in nature but it helps us to understand the intricacies of the recursive solution of any problem. Step by step analysis:-

We are developing source code as well as the flowcharts to analyze and study the behavior of recursive problem.
We are aiming to develop the design in such a way to cover all the corner scenarios which can occur in the real world.
We will also develop some scripts or makefile to automate the testing process.
